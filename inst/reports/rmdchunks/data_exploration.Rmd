# Data exploration

We start by visualising the observed delays from onset to report.

```{r plot_data}
ggplot(df, aes(x = delay)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, col = "#d3d3d36e") +
  theme_bw()
```

As expected, based on the generative model used to simulate our case study data, there are negative delays (report before onset) - possibly representing either data entry errors or positive tests during the incubation period so hard to characterise as part of the reporting delay distribution.

```{r negative_delays}
df |>
  filter(delay < 0)
```

There is also a significant excess at delay 0, which does not connect smoothly to the rest of the distribution and therefore might represent a separate process or the combination of two processes.
