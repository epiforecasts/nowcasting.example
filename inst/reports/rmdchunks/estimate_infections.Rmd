## Preliminary estimate of the serial interval is 9.8 days though with high uncertainty (95% credible interval, 5.9 to 21.4).
## It is unclear whether this refers to the estimate of the mean, or the spread of serial intervals
## It is also unclear whether this is growth-adjusted
## interpreted as discretised gamma distributed with mean (5.9 + 21.4) / 2 = 13.65

## incubation period
## from: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox
## "usually from 6 to 13 days but can range from 5 to 21"
## interpreted as log-normally distributed with 2/3 contained between 6 and 13:

## => \mu* = 9, \sigma* = 1.5,  max = 21
