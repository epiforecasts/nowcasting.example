## generation interval
## from: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-technical-briefings/investigation-into-monkeypox-outbreak-in-england-technical-briefing-1
## Preliminary estimate of the serial interval is 9.8 days though with high uncertainty (95% credible interval, 5.9 to 21.4).
## It is unclear whether this refers to the estimate of the mean, or the spread of serial intervals
## It is also unclear whether this is growth-adjusted.
## We interpret it here as discretised gamma distributed with mean (5.9 + 21.4) / 2 = 13.65
## and sd = sqrt(13.65) = 3.7 (THIS IS FOR ILLUSTRATION ONLY AND SHOULD NOT BE USED)
generation_interval <- Gamma(
  mean = 13.65,
  sd = 3.7,
  max = 25
)

## incubation period
## from: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox
## "usually from 6 to 13 days but can range from 5 to 21"
## interpreted as log-normally distributed with 2/3 contained between 6 and 13:
## => \mu*/\sigma* = 6; \mu^* * \sigma* = 13
## => \mu* = 9, \sigma* = 1.5,  max = 21
## (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution#Scatter_intervals)
## also adding a small amount of uncertainty
incubation_period <- LogNormal(
  meanlog = Normal(log(9), 0.1),
  sdlog = Normal(log(1.5), 0.1),
  max = 21
)
